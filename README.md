# World Weather Analysis :sunny:
Analysis Using Jupyter Notebooks, Python, Pandas, + APIs 

### The purpose of this project is to use an Api to retrieve data from World Weather, Google Place Api and Direction Api. Using random generated number to simulate coordinates to get a list of 2000 cities, we gathered a picture of city and it's weather information from World Weather. Using Google Place, we obtained location information such as hotel to plot, and we retreived the direction route of 4 cities by providing the city coordinates.

### Initially, we were interesting in the weather data, but we need to provide coordinates to provide the Api to get that information. By using random number generator of the numpy library we easily generated those numbers randomly. 
### Secoundly, we provided those coordinates to Goolge to retreieve the hotel infomation of those places. By using gmaps.marker_layer method we can easily plot that infomation on Google world map.
### Finally, we used Google Direction Api to generate a route between 4 cities we were interested in, and plotted them with markers.
